  "content": "## What is Organization Structure?\n\nOrganization structure is the formal system of:\n- **Division of work**: How tasks are allocated\n- **Coordination**: How work is integrated\n- **Control**: How performance is managed\n\nStructure follows strategy. The right structure enables your strategy; the wrong one creates friction.\n\n## Core Structural Elements\n\n### 1. Specialization\n\nHow much are jobs divided into narrow tasks?\n\n**High specialization:**\n- Deep expertise\n- Efficient for repetitive work\n- Can create silos\n\n**Low specialization:**\n- Broader roles\n- More flexibility\n- Requires versatile people\n\n### 2. Departmentalization\n\nHow are jobs grouped together?\n\n**By function:** Marketing, Engineering, Finance\n**By product:** Consumer Products, Enterprise, Services\n**By geography:** North America, EMEA, APAC\n**By customer:** Small Business, Enterprise, Government\n**By process:** Order Processing, Manufacturing, Delivery\n\n### 3. Chain of Command\n\nWho reports to whom?\n\n- Clear authority lines\n- Unity of command (one boss)\n- Scalar principle (unbroken line to top)\n\n### 4. Span of Control\n\nHow many people report to each manager?\n\n**Narrow span (3-5):**\n- Close supervision\n- More management layers\n- Higher overhead\n\n**Wide span (10-15):**\n- Employee autonomy\n- Fewer layers\n- Lower overhead\n\n### 5. Centralization\n\nWhere are decisions made?\n\n**Centralized:**\n- Top management decides\n- Consistency\n- Slower response\n\n**Decentralized:**\n- Decisions pushed down\n- Speed and flexibility\n- Potential inconsistency\n\n### 6. Formalization\n\nHow much is work behavior controlled by rules?\n\n**High formalization:**\n- Detailed procedures\n- Predictable behavior\n- Less flexibility\n\n**Low formalization:**\n- General guidelines\n- Discretion\n- Requires judgment\n\n## Common Structure Types\n\n### Functional Structure\n\n```\n           CEO\n            │\n    ┌───────┼───────┐\n    │       │       │\n Marketing  Eng   Finance\n```\n\n**Best for:** Small to medium companies with narrow product lines\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Develops functional expertise\n- Efficient resource use\n- Clear career paths\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Slow cross-functional coordination\n- Subunit goals may override org goals\n- Hard to scale across products/regions\n\n### Divisional Structure\n\n```\n           CEO\n            │\n    ┌───────┼───────┐\n    │       │       │\n Product A  B       C\n    │\n ┌──┼──┐\n M  E  F\n```\n\n**Best for:** Large companies with diverse products or markets\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Accountability for P&L\n- Responsive to market\n- Develops general managers\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Duplicate functions across divisions\n- Potential competition for resources\n- Harder to share expertise\n\n### Matrix Structure\n\n```\n              CEO\n               │\n       ┌───────┼───────┐\n       │       │       │\n    Marketing  Eng   Finance\n       │       │       │\n   ────┼───────┼───────┼──── Product A Manager\n       │       │       │\n   ────┼───────┼───────┼──── Product B Manager\n```\n\n**Best for:** Complex environments requiring dual focus (e.g., product AND region)\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Flexibility\n- Efficient resource use\n- Dual perspectives on decisions\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Dual reporting (two bosses)\n- Potential power struggles\n- Slower decision-making\n- Higher coordination costs\n\n### Flat Structure\n\n```\n       CEO\n        │\n    ┌───┼───┬───┬───┬───┐\n    │   │   │   │   │   │\n   T1  T2  T3  T4  T5  T6\n```\n\n**Best for:** Small organizations, creative industries, startups\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Fast communication\n- Employee empowerment\n- Low overhead\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Manager overload\n- Confusion about authority\n- Hard to scale\n\n### Network Structure\n\n```\n    Supplier ←→ Core Firm ←→ Distributor\n        ↑           │            ↑\n        └───── Partner ──────────┘\n```\n\n**Best for:** Virtual organizations, project-based work\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Flexibility\n- Access to specialized capabilities\n- Low fixed costs\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Less control\n- Knowledge leakage risk\n- Coordination complexity\n\n## Choosing a Structure\n\n### Key Questions\n\n1. **Strategy**: What are we trying to achieve?\n2. **Environment**: How stable or dynamic is our market?\n3. **Size**: How big are we?\n4. **Technology**: How complex is our work?\n5. **Culture**: What behaviors do we want to encourage?\n\n### Structure-Strategy Fit\n\n| Strategy | Best Structure |\n|----------|----------------|\n| Cost leadership | Functional, centralized, formalized |\n| Differentiation | Flexible, decentralized, cross-functional |\n| Growth | Divisional by product or geography |\n| Innovation | Flat, project-based, network |\n| Multi-business | Holding company or divisional |\n\n## Common Design Mistakes\n\n| Mistake | Symptom | Solution |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Structure-strategy mismatch | Strategy stalls | Realign structure to strategy |\n| Too many layers | Slow decisions | Flatten hierarchy |\n| Unclear accountability | Finger-pointing | Single points of accountability |\n| Siloed functions | Poor collaboration | Cross-functional teams |\n| Over-centralization | Slow response | Push decisions to front line |\n| Under-centralization | Inconsistency | Establish standards |\n\n## Organization Design Process\n\n### Step 1: Clarify Strategy\n\nWhat are the most important capabilities the structure must enable?\n\n### Step 2: Define Core Processes\n\nWhat work flows across the organization? How should it be coordinated?\n\n### Step 3: Group Work Logically\n\nBy function, product, customer, geography, or process?\n\n### Step 4: Establish Authority\n\nWho decides what? How much autonomy at each level?\n\n### Step 5: Design Coordination Mechanisms\n\nMeetings, liaisons, teams, systems?\n\n### Step 6: Test and Iterate\n\nPilot changes, gather feedback, adjust.\n\n## Key Insight\n\nThere is no perfect structure—only trade-offs. Every structure optimizes for some things at the expense of others. Functional structures build expertise but slow cross-functional work. Flat structures enable speed but can overload managers. The best structure is one that enables your most important strategic priorities while managing the downsides.",
