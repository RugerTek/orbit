  "content": "## What is a Role?\n\nA role is a defined set of responsibilities, authorities, and accountabilities within an organization. Unlike a job title, a role describes what someone actually does and is responsible for.\n\n**Role vs. Job Title:**\n- **Job Title**: Marketing Manager (label)\n- **Role**: Leads demand generation strategy, manages $500K budget, supervises 3 team members (substance)\n\n## The Three Components of a Role\n\n### 1. Responsibility\n\nWhat the person is expected to do.\n\n- Specific duties and tasks\n- Ongoing functions to maintain\n- Projects to deliver\n- Processes to execute\n\n### 2. Authority\n\nWhat the person can decide or control.\n\n- Decision-making scope\n- Budget authority\n- Hiring/firing authority\n- Resource allocation\n- Signing authority\n\n### 3. Accountability\n\nWhat the person is answerable for.\n\n- Outcomes and results\n- Metrics and KPIs\n- Quality standards\n- Compliance requirements\n\n**Key Principle:** Responsibility without authority leads to frustration. Authority without accountability leads to chaos.\n\n## Role Design Principles\n\n### 1. Single Point of Accountability\n\nEvery significant outcome should have exactly one person accountable.\n\n- **Good**: \"Sarah is accountable for customer retention\"\n- **Bad**: \"The customer success team is responsible for retention\"\n\nMultiple people can be responsible for contributing, but one person must be accountable for the outcome.\n\n### 2. Appropriate Scope\n\nA role should be:\n- **Large enough** to be meaningful and motivating\n- **Small enough** to be manageable by one person\n- **Clear enough** to avoid overlap with other roles\n\n### 3. Natural Grouping\n\nGroup responsibilities that:\n- Require similar skills\n- Share common information needs\n- Have interdependent outcomes\n- Benefit from single-point coordination\n\n### 4. Growth Path\n\nDesign roles that:\n- Have clear progression to next-level roles\n- Allow skill development within the role\n- Connect to organizational career frameworks\n\n## Common Role Design Mistakes\n\n| Mistake | Problem | Solution |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Responsibility without authority | Person can't execute | Grant decision rights |\n| Overlapping accountability | Confusion, finger-pointing | Single owner per outcome |\n| Too broad scope | Role is impossible | Split into multiple roles |\n| Too narrow scope | Role is demotivating | Expand or combine roles |\n| Undefined boundaries | Constant conflict | Document role boundaries |\n| No growth path | Talent leaves | Connect to career framework |\n\n## Role Documentation Template\n\nEvery role should document:\n\n### Purpose\nOne sentence describing why this role exists.\n\n### Key Accountabilities\n3-7 major outcomes this role is accountable for.\n\n### Key Responsibilities\nOngoing duties and functions performed.\n\n### Authority\nDecision rights and resource control.\n\n### Relationships\n- Reports to: [Role]\n- Supervises: [Roles]\n- Collaborates with: [Roles]\n\n### Requirements\n- Skills needed\n- Experience required\n- Certifications (if any)\n\n### Success Metrics\nHow performance is measured.\n\n## Role vs. Function\n\n| Concept | Definition | Example |\n|---------|------------|----------|\n| **Role** | Position filled by a person | \"Product Manager\" |\n| **Function** | Capability the org needs | \"Product Requirements Definition\" |\n\nRoles perform functions. One role can perform multiple functions, and one function can be performed by multiple roles.\n\n**Example:**\n- Role: Senior Developer\n- Functions performed: Code Review, Technical Design, Mentoring, Feature Development\n\n## Span of Control Guidelines\n\nHow many direct reports a role should manage:\n\n| Context | Recommended Span | Rationale |\n|---------|------------------|------------|\n| Routine work, experienced team | 10-15 | Low coordination needs |\n| Standard knowledge work | 6-10 | Moderate oversight |\n| Complex/creative work | 4-6 | High interaction needs |\n| New team/high change | 3-5 | Intensive development |\n\n**Factors affecting span:**\n- Geographic distribution\n- Work complexity\n- Team experience level\n- Manager's experience\n- Degree of standardization\n\n## Key Insight\n\nWell-designed roles enable both individual effectiveness and organizational agility. When roles are clear, people know what's expected, can make decisions confidently, and can be held accountable for outcomes. This clarity is the foundation of organizational performance.",
