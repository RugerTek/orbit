  "content": "## What is RACI?\n\nRACI is a responsibility assignment matrix that clarifies roles and responsibilities for activities, decisions, or deliverables.\n\n## The Four RACI Roles\n\n### R - Responsible\n\n**\"Does the work\"**\n\n- Executes the task or activity\n- Multiple people can be Responsible\n- At least one R required for every activity\n\n### A - Accountable\n\n**\"Owns the outcome\"**\n\n- Has final authority and accountability\n- Approves the work before it's complete\n- **Only ONE person can be Accountable** (this is critical)\n- The \"buck stops here\"\n\n### C - Consulted\n\n**\"Provides input\"**\n\n- Subject matter experts whose opinion is sought\n- Two-way communication (they give input, receive feedback)\n- Consulted BEFORE work is done or decision is made\n\n### I - Informed\n\n**\"Kept in the loop\"**\n\n- Notified of outcomes or decisions\n- One-way communication (they receive updates)\n- Informed AFTER work is done or decision is made\n\n## RACI Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exactly One A Per Row\n\nEvery activity must have exactly one Accountable person.\n\n- **No A**: Nobody owns it → it won't get done well\n- **Multiple A's**: Confusion → finger-pointing when things go wrong\n\n### Rule 2: At Least One R Per Row\n\nSomeone must do the work.\n\n### Rule 3: A Can Also Be R\n\nThe accountable person can also do the work, especially for smaller items.\n\n### Rule 4: Minimize C's and I's\n\nToo many consulted = slow decisions\nToo many informed = noise\n\n### Rule 5: Review for Overload\n\nIf one person has too many A's or R's across the matrix, they're overloaded.\n\n## Example RACI Matrix\n\n**Project: Launch New Product Feature**\n\n| Activity | PM | Dev Lead | Designer | QA | Marketing |\n|----------|----|---------|---------|----|----------|\n| Define requirements | A/R | C | C | I | C |\n| Create mockups | C | I | A/R | I | C |\n| Develop feature | I | A | C | I | I |\n| Write code | I | R | I | I | I |\n| Code review | I | A/R | I | I | I |\n| Test feature | C | C | I | A/R | I |\n| Write release notes | C | C | I | I | A/R |\n| Deploy to production | I | A/R | I | C | I |\n\n## Common RACI Problems\n\n| Problem | Symptom | Solution |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| No A assigned | Work falls through cracks | Assign single owner |\n| Multiple A's | Confusion, delays | Pick one owner |\n| A without authority | Frustration | Grant decision rights |\n| Too many C's | Slow decisions | Reduce to essential |\n| Too many I's | Information overload | Reduce to need-to-know |\n| R without resources | Failure to deliver | Provide time/tools |\n| Entire row blank | Activity not owned | Assign roles |\n\n## RACI Variations\n\n### RASCI\nAdds **S - Supportive**: Provides resources or support (not just consulted).\n\n### RAPID\nUsed for decisions:\n- **R - Recommend**: Proposes a decision\n- **A - Agree**: Must agree (has veto)\n- **P - Perform**: Implements once decided\n- **I - Input**: Consulted for input\n- **D - Decide**: Makes the final call\n\n### DACI\nSimplified for decisions:\n- **D - Driver**: Drives the decision process\n- **A - Approver**: Makes the decision\n- **C - Contributors**: Provide input\n- **I - Informed**: Notified of outcome\n\n## When to Use RACI\n\n**Best for:**\n- Cross-functional projects\n- New processes being established\n- Areas with historical confusion\n- Onboarding new team members\n- Clarifying decision rights\n\n**Overkill for:**\n- Well-established, routine work\n- Small, co-located teams\n- Simple, single-owner tasks\n\n## Creating a RACI Matrix\n\n### Step 1: List Activities\nIdentify all key activities, decisions, or deliverables.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Roles\nList all roles involved (not specific people initially).\n\n### Step 3: Assign RACI\nFor each activity, assign R, A, C, I to relevant roles.\n\n### Step 4: Validate\n- One A per row?\n- At least one R per row?\n- Any overloaded roles?\n- Any missing roles?\n\n### Step 5: Review with Stakeholders\nGet buy-in from all assigned roles.\n\n### Step 6: Communicate and Use\nMake the matrix accessible and reference it in workflows.\n\n## Key Insight\n\nRACI's power is in forcing clarity. The act of creating a RACI matrix often reveals hidden assumptions, undefined ownership, and process gaps. Even if the matrix is never referenced again, the conversations it triggers are valuable.\n\n**Remember:** One A per row. This simple rule prevents more organizational dysfunction than any other.",
