  "content": "## What is Coverage Analysis?\n\nCoverage analysis examines how well your organizational functions are staffed and supported. It identifies:\n\n- **Gaps**: Functions no one performs\n- **SPOF**: Functions only one person can do\n- **At-Risk**: Functions with insufficient backup\n- **Over-Covered**: Functions with excess capacity\n\n## Coverage Status Framework\n\n### Gap (Critical Risk)\n\n**Definition:** No one is assigned to perform this function.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- Function exists in catalog but no roles assigned\n- Function was performed by someone who left\n- New function identified but not yet staffed\n\n**Impact:**\n- Work doesn't get done\n- Customer issues, compliance failures\n- Reactive firefighting\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Assign to existing role\n- Create new role\n- Outsource or automate\n\n### SPOF - Single Point of Failure (High Risk)\n\n**Definition:** Only one person can perform this function.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- Single role assigned\n- No documented backup\n- Knowledge not transferred\n\n**Impact:**\n- Total loss of capability if person leaves\n- Vacation/illness creates gaps\n- Knowledge loss risk\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Cross-train backup person\n- Document procedures\n- Consider automation\n\n### At Risk (Medium Risk)\n\n**Definition:** Limited coverage; backup exists but is inadequate.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- 2-3 people can do it, but barely\n- Backup person is not fully trained\n- High turnover in assigned roles\n\n**Impact:**\n- Pressure on few people\n- Delays during absences\n- Quality issues under load\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Expand training\n- Add capacity\n- Improve documentation\n\n### Covered (Low Risk)\n\n**Definition:** Multiple qualified people; adequate redundancy.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- 3+ trained people\n- Clear backup assignments\n- Documented procedures\n\n**Impact:**\n- Resilient capability\n- Flexibility for absences\n- Knowledge distributed\n\n**Maintenance:**\n- Keep skills current\n- Update documentation\n- Monitor for changes\n\n## Conducting Coverage Analysis\n\n### Step 1: Inventory Functions\n\nEnsure your function catalog is current:\n- All critical functions listed\n- Clear function definitions\n- Categorized by department/domain\n\n### Step 2: Map Roles to Functions\n\nFor each function:\n- Which roles can perform it?\n- At what proficiency level?\n- Is there a primary and backup?\n\n### Step 3: Assess Capacity\n\nFor each function:\n- How many people are assigned?\n- What percentage of their time?\n- Are they overloaded?\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Coverage Score\n\n**Simple scoring:**\n```\nCoverage Score = Number of Qualified People × Average Proficiency\n```\n\n| Score | Status |\n|-------|--------|\n| 0 | Gap |\n| 0.1-1.0 | SPOF |\n| 1.1-2.0 | At Risk |\n| 2.1+ | Covered |\n\n### Step 5: Identify Priority Actions\n\nRank by:\n1. Criticality of function × Risk level\n2. Ease of resolution\n3. Available resources\n\n## Coverage Analysis Matrix\n\n| Function | Criticality | People | Status | Priority |\n|----------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Payroll Processing | Critical | 1 | SPOF | 1 |\n| Security Compliance | Critical | 0 | Gap | 1 |\n| Contract Review | High | 2 | At Risk | 2 |\n| Marketing Analytics | Medium | 1 | SPOF | 3 |\n| Travel Booking | Low | 3 | Covered | - |\n\n## Common Patterns and Solutions\n\n### The Indispensable Expert\n\n**Pattern:** One senior person holds critical knowledge.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Pair programming/shadowing\n- Documentation sprints\n- Succession planning\n- Consider retention incentives\n\n### The Overloaded Role\n\n**Pattern:** One role is primary for too many functions.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Role redesign\n- Function redistribution\n- Hire additional capacity\n- Automate routine functions\n\n### The Hidden Function\n\n**Pattern:** Someone informally performs a function not in their role.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Formalize in role description\n- Add to function catalog\n- Ensure backup coverage\n\n### The Stale Backup\n\n**Pattern:** Backup person hasn't performed function in months/years.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Regular rotation\n- Periodic drill exercises\n- Refresher training\n\n## Metrics to Track\n\n| Metric | Formula | Target |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| Gap Rate | Functions with Gap / Total Functions | < 5% |\n| SPOF Rate | Functions with SPOF / Total Functions | < 15% |\n| Coverage Index | Covered Functions / Total Functions | > 70% |\n| Critical SPOF | Critical Functions with SPOF | 0 |\n\n## Integration with Workforce Planning\n\nCoverage analysis feeds into:\n\n1. **Hiring decisions**: Which functions need more capacity?\n2. **Training investments**: Where should we cross-train?\n3. **Succession planning**: Which SPOFs are retirement risks?\n4. **Automation priorities**: Which SPOF functions could be automated?\n5. **Outsourcing decisions**: Which gaps could be filled externally?\n\n## Key Insight\n\nCoverage analysis transforms intuition into data. Most organizations \"know\" they have SPOFs but can't quantify them. By systematically analyzing coverage, you can prioritize investments, justify headcount, and reduce risk before it becomes crisis.",
