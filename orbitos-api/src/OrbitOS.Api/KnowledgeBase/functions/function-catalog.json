  "content": "## What is a Function Catalog?\n\nA function catalog is a comprehensive inventory of all the capabilities (functions) your organization needs to operate. It answers: \"What do we need to be able to do?\"\n\n## Functions vs. Roles vs. Processes\n\n| Concept | Question Answered | Example |\n|---------|-------------------|----------|\n| **Function** | What capability is needed? | \"Financial Reporting\" |\n| **Role** | Who provides the capability? | \"Controller\" |\n| **Process** | How is the capability delivered? | \"Monthly Close Process\" |\n\nFunctions are the \"what\" that connects the \"who\" (roles) and the \"how\" (processes).\n\n## Why Build a Function Catalog?\n\n### 1. Identify Coverage Gaps\nDoes anyone own \"Customer Retention\"? Is \"Security Compliance\" assigned?\n\n### 2. Find Redundancies\nAre three different teams all doing \"Market Research\"?\n\n### 3. Spot Single Points of Failure (SPOF)\nIf only one person can do \"Payroll Processing,\" what happens when they leave?\n\n### 4. Enable Workforce Planning\nWhat functions are at risk? What skills do we need to hire?\n\n### 5. Support Process Design\nWhich functions are involved in each process? Who needs to be consulted?\n\n## Function Catalog Structure\n\n### Core Fields\n\n| Field | Description | Example |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| Function Name | Clear, action-oriented name | \"Process Customer Refunds\" |\n| Category | Grouping for organization | \"Finance\" or \"Customer Service\" |\n| Description | What this function entails | \"Handle refund requests...\" |\n| Criticality | How critical to operations | Critical / High / Medium / Low |\n\n### Coverage Fields\n\n| Field | Description | Example |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| Assigned Roles | Which roles perform this | [\"CS Rep\", \"CS Manager\"] |\n| Coverage Status | Current staffing state | Covered / At Risk / SPOF / Gap |\n| Backup Available | Is there redundancy? | Yes / No |\n\n### Optional Fields\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| Frequency | How often performed |\n| Volume | Scale of activity |\n| Complexity | Skill level required |\n| Automation Potential | Could this be automated? |\n| Related Processes | Processes using this function |\n\n## Coverage Status Definitions\n\n| Status | Definition | Risk Level |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| **Covered** | Multiple qualified people; redundancy exists | Low |\n| **At Risk** | Few people qualified; limited backup | Medium |\n| **SPOF** | Single Point of Failure; only one person | High |\n| **Gap** | No one assigned; capability missing | Critical |\n\n## Building Your Function Catalog\n\n### Step 1: Gather Existing Documentation\n\n- Job descriptions\n- Process documentation\n- Org charts\n- Responsibility matrices\n- Training materials\n\n### Step 2: Interview Key Stakeholders\n\nAsk department heads and experienced employees:\n- What does your team do?\n- What are you responsible for?\n- What would break if you weren't here?\n\n### Step 3: Categorize Functions\n\nGroup functions into logical categories:\n\n**By Department:**\n- Finance\n- Operations\n- Sales\n- Marketing\n- HR\n- Technology\n\n**By Value Chain:**\n- Inbound Logistics\n- Operations\n- Outbound Logistics\n- Marketing & Sales\n- Service\n\n**By Business Capability:**\n- Customer Management\n- Product Development\n- Supply Chain\n- Financial Management\n\n### Step 4: Assess Coverage\n\nFor each function:\n1. Who performs this function today?\n2. How many people can do it?\n3. What happens if they're unavailable?\n4. Is there documentation?\n\n### Step 5: Prioritize Gaps\n\nFocus on:\n1. Critical functions with SPOF or Gap status\n2. High-volume functions with coverage risk\n3. Regulatory/compliance functions\n\n## Function Catalog Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use Action-Oriented Names\n\n**Good:** \"Process Accounts Payable\"\n**Bad:** \"AP\" or \"Accounts Payable\"\n\n### 2. Right Level of Granularity\n\nToo broad: \"Finance\" (this is a department)\nToo narrow: \"Enter invoice line item\" (this is a task)\nRight level: \"Process Vendor Invoices\"\n\n### 3. Keep It Current\n\nReview quarterly or when:\n- New roles are created\n- People leave or join\n- Processes change\n\n### 4. Link to Other Systems\n\nConnect functions to:\n- Roles (who can do it)\n- Processes (where it's performed)\n- Training (how to learn it)\n- Job postings (what we need to hire)\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n| Mistake | Problem | Solution |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Confusing functions with roles | Losing sight of capabilities | Function = capability, role = person |\n| Too granular | Overwhelming, unmaintainable | Aim for 50-200 functions |\n| Too broad | No actionable insight | Break down vague functions |\n| One-time exercise | Quickly outdated | Make it a living document |\n| No ownership | Nobody maintains it | Assign catalog owner |\n\n## Key Insight\n\nA function catalog is a mirror for your organization. It shows not just what you do, but what you might be missing, where you're vulnerable, and where you have hidden redundancy. The catalog itself has modest value—the insights it reveals are invaluable.",
