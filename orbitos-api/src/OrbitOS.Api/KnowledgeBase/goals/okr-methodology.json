  "content": "## What are OKRs?\n\nOKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a goal-setting framework that defines:\n\n- **Objectives**: What you want to achieve (qualitative, inspirational)\n- **Key Results**: How you measure progress (quantitative, measurable)\n\nDeveloped at Intel by Andy Grove, popularized by John Doerr at Google.\n\n## OKR Structure\n\n### Objectives\n\n**Characteristics of good Objectives:**\n- Qualitative and inspirational\n- Time-bound (typically quarterly)\n- Actionable by the team\n- Ambitious but achievable\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Become the most trusted brand in our market\"\n- \"Create a world-class customer experience\"\n- \"Build a high-performing engineering culture\"\n\n**Not objectives:**\n- \"Increase revenue by 20%\" (this is a Key Result)\n- \"Launch the new product\" (this is a task)\n- \"Be profitable\" (too vague, not actionable)\n\n### Key Results\n\n**Characteristics of good Key Results:**\n- Quantitative and measurable\n- Specific with clear metrics\n- Challenging but possible (70% achievement is success)\n- 2-5 per Objective\n\n**Examples:**\n```\nObjective: Become the most trusted brand in our market\n\nKR1: Increase NPS from 32 to 50\nKR2: Achieve 4.5+ rating on G2 Crowd\nKR3: Reduce customer churn from 5% to 3%\nKR4: Increase repeat purchase rate from 40% to 55%\n```\n\n**Not Key Results:**\n- \"Improve customer satisfaction\" (not measurable)\n- \"Launch mobile app\" (this is a task/initiative)\n- \"More sales\" (not specific)\n\n## OKR Cycle\n\n### Annual OKRs\n\n- Company-level direction\n- 3-5 strategic Objectives\n- Set at start of fiscal year\n- Reviewed quarterly\n\n### Quarterly OKRs\n\n- Team and individual level\n- Aligned to annual OKRs\n- 3-5 Objectives per quarter\n- Weekly check-ins, monthly reviews\n\n### Typical Timeline\n\n| Week | Activity |\n|------|----------|\n| Week -2 | Leadership drafts company OKRs |\n| Week -1 | Teams draft team OKRs |\n| Week 1 | OKRs finalized and shared |\n| Weeks 2-12 | Execution with weekly check-ins |\n| Week 13 | Score and reflect |\n| Week 14 | Plan next quarter |\n\n## Scoring OKRs\n\n### The 0.0-1.0 Scale\n\n| Score | Meaning |\n|-------|----------|\n| 0.0-0.3 | Failed to make real progress |\n| 0.4-0.6 | Made progress but fell short |\n| 0.7-0.9 | Hit the goal (this is success!) |\n| 1.0 | Exceeded expectations |\n\n**Important:** Scoring 1.0 consistently means your goals aren't ambitious enough.\n\n### Scoring Examples\n\n```\nKR: Increase NPS from 32 to 50\n\nActual: NPS reached 45\nScore: (45-32) / (50-32) = 13/18 = 0.72\nAssessment: Good progress, goal was appropriately ambitious\n```\n\n## OKR Alignment\n\n### Vertical Alignment\n\nCompany OKRs cascade to departments, then to teams, then to individuals.\n\n```\nCompany Objective: Become #1 in customer satisfaction\n  ↓\nDepartment (Support) Objective: Deliver exceptional support experience\n  ↓\nTeam Objective: Reduce customer effort in issue resolution\n  ↓\nIndividual Objective: Master new ticketing system to improve response time\n```\n\n### Horizontal Alignment\n\nTeams coordinate when their OKRs depend on each other.\n\n```\nEngineering KR: Launch new API by March 15\n        ↔ depends on ↔\nMarketing KR: Drive 1,000 developer signups to new API\n```\n\n## OKRs vs. KPIs vs. Tasks\n\n| Concept | Purpose | Example |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| **OKR** | Achieve change | \"Increase NPS from 32 to 50\" |\n| **KPI** | Monitor health | \"Track NPS monthly\" |\n| **Task** | Complete work | \"Implement feedback widget\" |\n\nOKRs drive improvement. KPIs maintain awareness. Tasks are the work.\n\n## Common OKR Mistakes\n\n### 1. Too Many OKRs\n\n**Problem:** 10+ objectives per quarter\n**Solution:** Maximum 3-5 objectives, 2-5 KRs each\n\n### 2. Sandbagging\n\n**Problem:** Setting easy goals to guarantee 1.0 scores\n**Solution:** Emphasize learning over scoring; 0.7 is success\n\n### 3. Key Results as Tasks\n\n**Problem:** \"Launch new website\" as a KR\n**Solution:** Measure outcomes: \"Increase conversion rate from 2% to 4%\"\n\n### 4. Set and Forget\n\n**Problem:** Set OKRs quarterly, never review\n**Solution:** Weekly check-ins, monthly progress reviews\n\n### 5. Using OKRs for Performance Reviews\n\n**Problem:** OKRs tied to compensation\n**Solution:** Keep OKRs for alignment; separate performance systems\n\n### 6. No Initiatives\n\n**Problem:** OKRs without a plan to achieve them\n**Solution:** Link initiatives (projects, tasks) to each KR\n\n## OKR Best Practices\n\n### Writing Good OKRs\n\n1. Start with \"Why?\" - What change matters?\n2. Write Objective first, then Key Results\n3. Use verbs that imply measurement (increase, reduce, achieve)\n4. Include baseline and target in KRs\n5. Test: \"Will I know when this is done?\"\n\n### Managing OKRs\n\n1. **Transparency**: Make all OKRs visible to everyone\n2. **Weekly check-ins**: Quick confidence ratings\n3. **Monthly reviews**: Deeper progress discussion\n4. **Quarterly retrospectives**: What did we learn?\n\n### OKR Confidence Rating\n\nWeekly, rate each KR:\n\n| Rating | Meaning |\n|--------|----------|\n| On track | Expected to hit 0.7+ |\n| At risk | Might fall short |\n| Off track | Will miss unless intervention |\n\n## Key Insight\n\nOKRs work because they create focus and alignment. By limiting objectives and making progress transparent, teams concentrate on what matters most. The framework's real power is in the conversations it generates—about priorities, dependencies, and what success really looks like.",
