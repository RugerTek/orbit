  "content": "## Overview\n\nIndustrial Engineering uses standardized symbols from ASME Y15.3 and ISO 5807 to document and analyze processes. Each symbol represents a specific type of activity, helping identify value-adding work versus waste.\n\n## Value Classification\n\n- **Value-Adding (Green)**: Work the customer would pay for - primarily Operations\n- **Required Waste (Yellow)**: Necessary but adds no direct value - required inspections, compliance\n- **Pure Waste (Red)**: Target for elimination - unnecessary transport, delays, excess storage\n\n## Symbol Reference\n\n### Operation (Large Circle)\nThe primary value-adding activity. Operations transform materials, add value, or directly contribute to the product/service.\n\n**Examples**: Machine part, assemble component, package product, write code\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Operation Type: fabrication, assembly, processing, packaging, service\n- Workstation: Machine or station where work is performed\n- Setup Time: Changeover time (for SMED analysis)\n- Standard Time: Time per unit from time study\n- Pieces/Hour: Throughput rate\n\n### Inspection (Square)\nQuality check or verification step where items are examined against standards.\n\n**Examples**: Visual quality check, dimensional measurement, functional testing\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Inspection Criteria: What standards are being checked\n- Pass Rate %: First pass yield\n- Sampling Rate %: 100 = inspect all\n- Failure Disposition: rework, scrap, downgrade, review\n- DPU/DPMO: Defects per unit / Defects per million opportunities\n\n### Transport (Circle with Arrow)\nMovement of materials or information from one location to another. Generally non-value-adding.\n\n**Examples**: Move parts to assembly, deliver to shipping dock, transfer files\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Distance: How far the item travels\n- Transport Mode: manual, forklift, conveyor, cart, AGV\n- Origin/Destination: Start and end locations\n- Trips per Shift: Frequency of movement\n\n**Tip**: Minimize transport distance. Consider co-locating related operations.\n\n### Delay (D-Shape)\nWait or queue time where work items are idle. Pure waste unless technically required.\n\n**Examples**: Queue for approval, waiting for batch, curing time, cooling period\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Delay Reason: queue, batch, approval, curing, drying, cooling, scheduling\n- Average Wait: Typical wait time in minutes\n- Is Technically Required: true for curing/cooling, false for queues\n- Average Queue Length: WIP at this point\n\n**Tip**: Distinguish necessary delays (curing) from unnecessary ones (queue). Target unnecessary delays for elimination.\n\n### Storage (Inverted Triangle)\nControlled storage of materials, WIP, or finished goods. Ties up capital and space.\n\n**Examples**: Raw material warehouse, WIP staging, finished goods inventory\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Storage Type: raw, wip, finished, tools, consumables\n- Capacity: Maximum storage amount\n- Inventory Method: FIFO, LIFO, FEFO\n- Average Days of Inventory: How long items sit\n- Carrying Cost %: Annual cost to hold inventory\n\n### Document (Wavy Rectangle)\nCreation or use of paper/digital documents.\n\n**Examples**: Fill out form, generate report, review specification\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Document Type: form, report, checklist, certificate, drawing\n- Document Code: Tracking number\n- Is Controlled: Whether version-controlled\n\n### Database (Cylinder)\nInteraction with data storage systems.\n\n**Examples**: Update ERP, query inventory, log transaction\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- System Name: SAP, Oracle, custom app\n- Operation: read, write, both\n- Integration Type: direct, API, file, message\n\n### Manual Input (Parallelogram)\nPoint where a person enters data into a system.\n\n**Examples**: Enter order details, scan barcode, input measurements\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Input Device: keyboard, scanner, touchscreen, voice\n- Error Rate %: Data entry error rate\n\n### Display (Angled Rectangle)\nInformation displayed to workers or stakeholders.\n\n**Examples**: Work instructions, dashboard, andon board\n\n**Key Fields**:\n- Display Type: dashboard, alert, status, instruction\n- Refresh Rate: How often it updates\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Maximize Operation ratio**: The goal is to have most time spent on Operations (value-add)\n2. **Eliminate unnecessary Transport**: Co-locate sequential operations\n3. **Reduce Delays**: Target queue time for elimination; preserve only technically required waits\n4. **Minimize Storage**: Reduce inventory to decrease carrying costs and lead time\n5. **Track metrics**: Use Setup Time, Standard Time, and Pass Rate to identify improvement opportunities",
