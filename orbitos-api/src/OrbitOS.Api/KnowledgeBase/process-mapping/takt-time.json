  "content": "## What is Takt Time?\n\nTakt time is the maximum time you can spend on each unit while still meeting customer demand. It comes from the German word 'Takt' meaning rhythm or beat. Think of it as the heartbeat of your production system.\n\n## Formula\n\n```\nTakt Time = Available Work Time / Customer Demand\n```\n\n**Available Work Time**: Total production time minus breaks, maintenance, and planned downtime.\n\n**Customer Demand**: Number of units customers need in that time period.\n\n## Example Calculation\n\n**Scenario**: Your shift is 8 hours (480 minutes) with 30 minutes of breaks. Customers need 150 units per day.\n\n```\nAvailable Time = 480 - 30 = 450 minutes\nTakt Time = 450 / 150 = 3 minutes per unit\n```\n\n**Interpretation**: You must complete one unit every 3 minutes to meet demand.\n\n## Takt Time vs Cycle Time\n\n| Metric | Definition | Use |\n|--------|------------|-----|\n| **Takt Time** | Time ALLOWED per unit (demand-driven) | Target to meet |\n| **Cycle Time** | Time ACTUALLY taken per unit | Current performance |\n\n**If Cycle Time > Takt Time**: You have a bottleneck. You cannot meet demand without improvement or overtime.\n\n**If Cycle Time < Takt Time**: You have excess capacity. Consider whether you're overproducing.\n\n**If Cycle Time ≈ Takt Time**: You're balanced. This is the lean ideal.\n\n## How to Use Takt Time\n\n### 1. Balance the Line\nCompare each activity's cycle time to takt. Redistribute work so no station exceeds takt.\n\n### 2. Identify Bottlenecks\nAny activity with cycle time > takt is limiting throughput. Focus improvement here first.\n\n### 3. Prevent Overproduction\nActivities much faster than takt may be overproducing. Consider leveling production.\n\n### 4. Staff Planning\nDivide total work content by takt time to determine minimum headcount.\n\n```\nMinimum Staff = Total Cycle Time / Takt Time\n```\n\n## Adjusting Takt Time\n\nTakt time changes when:\n- Customer demand changes (seasonal, growth)\n- Available time changes (shift changes, maintenance schedules)\n\n**Important**: Don't change takt time to match poor performance. Takt is set by the customer, not by your capability.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Confusing takt with cycle time**: Takt is a target, cycle time is actual performance\n2. **Ignoring variability**: If cycle time has high variance, you need buffer or the average must be well below takt\n3. **Using gross time**: Always subtract breaks and planned downtime from available time\n4. **Not updating**: Recalculate when demand or availability changes",
