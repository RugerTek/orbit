  "content": "## What is OEE?\n\nOverall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is the gold standard for measuring manufacturing productivity. It identifies the percentage of planned production time that is truly productive.\n\n## The OEE Formula\n\n```\nOEE = Availability × Performance × Quality\n```\n\nEach factor is a percentage (0-100%), so OEE is also a percentage.\n\n### Availability\n\nMeasures unplanned downtime losses.\n\n```\nAvailability = Run Time / Planned Production Time × 100%\n```\n\n**Run Time** = Planned Production Time − Unplanned Stops\n\n**Losses captured:**\n- Equipment failures\n- Unplanned maintenance\n- Material shortages\n- Changeover/setup time (if unplanned)\n\n### Performance\n\nMeasures speed losses.\n\n```\nPerformance = (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Count) / Run Time × 100%\n```\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n```\nPerformance = (Total Count / Run Time) / Ideal Run Rate × 100%\n```\n\n**Losses captured:**\n- Slow cycles\n- Minor stops\n- Idling\n- Reduced speed operation\n\n### Quality\n\nMeasures defect losses.\n\n```\nQuality = Good Count / Total Count × 100%\n```\n\n**Losses captured:**\n- Defects/rejects\n- Rework\n- Startup rejects\n- In-process damage\n\n## Example Calculation\n\n**Scenario:** 8-hour shift (480 min planned)\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Planned Production Time | 480 min |\n| Downtime (breakdowns, changeovers) | 60 min |\n| Run Time | 420 min |\n| Ideal Cycle Time | 1 min/unit |\n| Total Units Produced | 350 units |\n| Good Units | 340 units |\n\n**Step 1: Availability**\n```\nAvailability = 420 / 480 = 87.5%\n```\n\n**Step 2: Performance**\n```\nPerformance = (1 × 350) / 420 = 83.3%\n```\n\n**Step 3: Quality**\n```\nQuality = 340 / 350 = 97.1%\n```\n\n**Step 4: OEE**\n```\nOEE = 87.5% × 83.3% × 97.1% = 70.8%\n```\n\n## The Six Big Losses\n\nOEE targets the Six Big Losses from Total Productive Maintenance (TPM):\n\n### Availability Losses\n\n| Loss | Description | Examples |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| 1. Equipment Failure | Unplanned stops due to breakdown | Motor failure, tooling break, sensor malfunction |\n| 2. Setup & Adjustments | Changeover and setup time | Product changes, material changes, startup adjustments |\n\n### Performance Losses\n\n| Loss | Description | Examples |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| 3. Idling & Minor Stops | Brief stops under 5 minutes | Jams, blocked sensors, misfeeds |\n| 4. Reduced Speed | Running below ideal cycle time | Worn equipment, operator inexperience, suboptimal settings |\n\n### Quality Losses\n\n| Loss | Description | Examples |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| 5. Process Defects | Defects during stable production | Out-of-spec parts, assembly errors |\n| 6. Startup Losses | Defects during warmup/startup | Startup rejects, first-article failures |\n\n## OEE Benchmarks\n\n| OEE Score | Rating | Interpretation |\n|-----------|--------|----------------|\n| < 40% | Poor | Significant improvement opportunity |\n| 40-60% | Typical | Common for untracked equipment |\n| 60-75% | Fair | Room for improvement |\n| 75-85% | Good | Competitive performance |\n| 85%+ | World-Class | Best-in-class performance |\n| 100% | Perfect | Perfect production (theoretical) |\n\n**World-Class Targets by Factor:**\n- Availability: 90%+\n- Performance: 95%+\n- Quality: 99.9%+\n\n## Improving OEE\n\n### Focus on the Biggest Loss First\n\n1. **Calculate each factor** separately\n2. **Identify the lowest factor** - this is your constraint\n3. **Attack the specific losses** within that factor\n\n### Common Improvement Strategies\n\n**For Availability:**\n- Implement preventive maintenance\n- Reduce changeover time (SMED)\n- Create standard operating procedures\n- Train operators on basic maintenance\n\n**For Performance:**\n- Identify and address bottlenecks\n- Eliminate minor stops with root cause analysis\n- Optimize machine settings\n- Ensure proper maintenance of wear parts\n\n**For Quality:**\n- Implement error-proofing (poka-yoke)\n- Statistical process control (SPC)\n- First-piece inspection protocols\n- Operator certification programs\n\n## OEE vs. Other Metrics\n\n| Metric | Scope | Use Case |\n|--------|-------|----------|\n| OEE | Single equipment | Equipment-level optimization |\n| TEEP | Total calendar time | Capacity utilization |\n| OLE | Labor effectiveness | Workforce optimization |\n| PCE | Process lead time | Flow optimization |\n\n### TEEP: Total Effective Equipment Performance\n\n```\nTEEP = OEE × Utilization\n```\n\nWhere Utilization = Planned Time / Total Calendar Time\n\nTEEP shows how much of the total available calendar time is productive.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Using actual cycle time instead of ideal** - Always use the theoretical best cycle time\n2. **Excluding changeover time** - Include it unless truly planned maintenance\n3. **Not counting startup defects** - All defects count, including warmup rejects\n4. **Averaging OEE across equipment** - Calculate separately, then understand the system\n5. **Focusing only on OEE number** - Understand which factor (A, P, or Q) is limiting\n\n## Key Insight\n\nOEE is multiplicative, not additive. Three \"pretty good\" factors can yield a mediocre OEE:\n\n```\n85% × 85% × 85% = 61.4% OEE\n```\n\nThis is why world-class companies target very high individual factors—small improvements compound into significant OEE gains.",
