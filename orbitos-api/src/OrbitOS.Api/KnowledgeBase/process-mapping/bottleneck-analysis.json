  "content": "## What is a Bottleneck?\n\nA bottleneck is any resource or activity that limits the output of the entire system. Like the narrow neck of a bottle, it restricts flow regardless of what happens elsewhere.\n\n**Key Insight**: The bottleneck sets the pace for the entire process. Improving non-bottleneck activities does NOT increase system throughput.\n\n## Identifying Bottlenecks\n\n### Method 1: Find the Longest Cycle Time\nThe activity with the highest cycle time is often the bottleneck.\n\n```\nActivities: A (2 min) → B (5 min) → C (3 min) → D (2 min)\nBottleneck: Activity B (5 min)\nMax Throughput: 12 units/hour (60/5)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Look for WIP Buildup\nWork-in-progress accumulates before bottlenecks. Check your Delay activities:\n- High average queue length = bottleneck downstream\n- High wait time = capacity constraint ahead\n\n### Method 3: Compare to Takt Time\nAny activity with cycle time > takt time is a bottleneck candidate.\n\n```\nTakt Time: 4 min\nActivity B Cycle Time: 5 min\n→ Activity B is a bottleneck (exceeds takt by 1 min)\n```\n\n## Theory of Constraints (TOC)\n\nEliyahu Goldratt's Theory of Constraints provides a systematic approach:\n\n### The Five Focusing Steps\n\n1. **IDENTIFY** the constraint\n   - Find the bottleneck using methods above\n\n2. **EXPLOIT** the constraint\n   - Maximize utilization of the bottleneck\n   - Never let it sit idle (lunch breaks, material shortages)\n   - Quality control before the bottleneck (don't waste bottleneck time on defects)\n\n3. **SUBORDINATE** everything else\n   - Run non-bottlenecks at the bottleneck's pace\n   - Don't overproduce upstream (creates WIP)\n   - Ensure bottleneck always has work waiting\n\n4. **ELEVATE** the constraint\n   - Add capacity: more equipment, staff, shifts\n   - Reduce cycle time: process improvement, automation\n   - Outsource bottleneck work\n\n5. **REPEAT**\n   - When you fix one bottleneck, another emerges\n   - Return to step 1 and find the new constraint\n\n## Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR)\n\nA scheduling method based on TOC:\n\n- **Drum**: The bottleneck sets the pace (the 'beat')\n- **Buffer**: Time buffer protects the bottleneck from upstream variability\n- **Rope**: Signal that pulls work into the system based on bottleneck consumption\n\n## Common Bottleneck Locations\n\n| Bottleneck Type | Signs | Solutions |\n|-----------------|-------|----------|\n| **Equipment** | High utilization, breakdown impact | Add capacity, improve reliability |\n| **Labor** | Skill shortage, overtime | Cross-train, hire, simplify |\n| **Material** | Stockouts, supplier delays | Safety stock, alternate suppliers |\n| **Information** | Waiting for approvals, data | Streamline decisions, automate |\n| **Policy** | Batch size requirements, sign-offs | Challenge policies, reduce batch |\n\n## Bottleneck Metrics to Track\n\n- **Utilization %**: Time bottleneck is productive vs. total available time\n- **Queue Length**: WIP waiting at the bottleneck\n- **Wait Time**: How long items wait before processing\n- **Throughput**: Units through the bottleneck per hour\n\n## Key Principle\n\n**An hour lost at the bottleneck is an hour lost for the entire system.**\n**An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is a mirage.**\n\nFocus improvement efforts on the constraint. Everything else is secondary.",
