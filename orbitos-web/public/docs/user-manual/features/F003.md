# Processes

Design and manage your organization's workflows with the visual process editor.

## Overview

Processes in OrbitOS help you:
- **Document** how work gets done
- **Visualize** workflow steps and decisions
- **Assign** responsibilities to activities
- **Track** process execution

## Creating a Process

1. Navigate to **Processes** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Process**
3. Enter a name and description
4. Use the visual editor to design the flow

## Visual Editor

The process editor provides:

### Nodes
- **Start/End** - Mark process boundaries
- **Activities** - Work steps
- **Decisions** - Branching points
- **Gateways** - Parallel or exclusive paths

### Connections
- Draw lines between nodes to show flow
- Add conditions to decision branches
- Create loops for repetitive steps

## Working with Activities

Each activity can include:
- **Name** - What the step is called
- **Description** - Detailed instructions
- **Assigned Role** - Who is responsible
- **Inputs/Outputs** - Required data or resources

### Adding an Activity

1. Click on the canvas or use the toolbar
2. Drag the activity to position it
3. Click to edit details
4. Connect to other activities

## Best Practices

- Start simple and add detail later
- Name activities with verb-noun pairs (e.g., "Review Document")
- Use decisions sparingly to keep flows clear
- Document exceptions in descriptions
